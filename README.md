# challenge3

## Description

In Challenge 3, we were assigned to add functionality to a random password generator with a prompt allowing the user to select which characters they'd like their password to include, which is:

. The number of characters (8 to 128)
. Whether they'd like capitalized or lowercase letters in their password
. Whether they'd like to include special characters in their password

## Installation

The password generator should run in the majority of modern browsers that support JavaScript.

## Usage

Click the "Generate" button in order to bring up the prompt. Enter a character limit between 8 to 128 characters, select what special characters you'd like, and your password will generate in the provided box.
